## Introduction
Forest fires cause immense ecological and economic damage, releasing carbon emissions and threatening lives and property. Prompt detection and response are crucial. This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze satellite and aerial imagery for early fire outbreak identification.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn
- **Data Manipulation Libraries**: pandas, NumPy
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forest-fire-detection.git
   cd forest-fire-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure you have the satellite and aerial imagery dataset in the appropriate format.

2. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Run the detection system**:
   ```bash
   python detect_fire.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes satellite and aerial images with labeled fire outbreaks. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. You can find publicly available datasets from sources like NASA, Google Earth Engine, and other remote sensing databases.

## Model Training
The model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify patterns and features indicative of forest fires in the imagery. Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model architecture design
- Training and validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation

## Results
The trained model achieves [accuracy/precision/recall metrics] on the test dataset. Visualizations of the detection results and performance metrics are provided in the `results` directory.
